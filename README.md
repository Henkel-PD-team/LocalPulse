# LocalPulse
## About
### Local Pulse is a lightweight software application from Henkel that runs on a customer’s computer or laptop to pull, display and save Loctite Equipment Machine data locally. Local Pulse will pull data from enabled IOT compatible Loctite machines every 30 seconds and then stores the data in a csv locally.
## To download:
### Navigate to Releases on the side and select the appropriate file (Windows or Mac/Linux).
## To use:
## * Please use a switch to connect your computer and the I4.0 capable devices using ethernet. The server will not start unless the switch is plugged in, or you are directly plugged into an RC50/SD30 via ethernet.
## ** If Wi-Fi is to be used, please contact technical support below.
### If on Mac/Linux, skip the next section, as it corresponds only to Windows.
### Windows Setup (How to video in Windows Release):
#### You must open ports 8088 for RC50 and 8089 for SD30 through your Windows Firewall <- create inbound rule for tcp ports 8088 and 8089.

##  This section is for all users
### Ensure that your machine's (computer/pc) IP address is set to static and is set to the following: 
#### IP: 192.168.4.127
#### Netmask: 255.255.255.0
#### Gateway (if needed): 192.168.4.1
##### ** RC50/SD30 should also reflect the same IP for the server field, same goes for the netmask and gateway. Device IP must be 192.168.4.* where * can be any number 1-255 except for 127 since the server is running on 127. Use Port 8088 for RC50 and 8089 for SD30.

##
### To run the application, please select and download the appropriate zip for your operating system (Mac for MacOS, and Windows for Windows). Extract the zip file and run the executable (if on Windows). If on Mac, it will show up as an application. Make sure to right click the application and select open to make sure MacOS will open the app <- first time only. Windows should have no issue running the executable. 

##
### To find the CSV files for your devices, navigate to your user's documents folder and there you should find the csv files labeled rc50_data.csv and sd30_data.csv.
#### To start over with a fresh csv, feel free to rename the csv files or move the old csv files out of your documents folder and it will repopulate when the application is run again.
